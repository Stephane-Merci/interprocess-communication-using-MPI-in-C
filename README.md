## Key Features:

MPI for Parallelism: Leverages MPI for multi-process communication and collaboration.
Data Distribution and Reduction: Distributes the array among processes for parallel summation and gathers results using MPI_Reduce.
Clear Code Structure: Well-organized code with comments for learning and understanding.
Getting Started:

## Clone the repository.
Compile with an MPI compiler (e.g., mpicc -o array_sum array_sum.c).
Run with multiple processes (e.g., mpirun -np 4 ./array_sum).

## Learn More:

Examine the code to grasp MPI functions and concepts.
Experiment with different array sizes and process counts.
This project provides a practical introduction to distributed computing with MPI!
